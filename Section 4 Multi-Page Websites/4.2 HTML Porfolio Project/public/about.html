  pursuing my first year at NIT Delhi. Originally hailing from the beautiful state of Goa, I've always had a keen

  drawn to the elegance and power of C, the versatility of Java, and the creative potential of HTML. These languages
  have allowed me to bring my ideas to life and explore the exciting world of software development.</p>
<p>Currently, my focus lies on mastering the art of web development. I'm driven by the desire to create immersive and
  user-friendly online experiences. Through continuous learning and hands-on practice, I aim to refine my skills in
  front-end development, back-end functionality, and the integration of cutting-edge technologies.</p>
<p>Beyond coding, I enjoy immersing myself in various other hobbies and interests. Exploring the latest advancements in
  technology, reading insightful articles, and staying up-to-date with industry trends are some of the ways I nurture my
  curiosity and passion for the field.</p>
